My Web Development Learning Journey

Week 1 Summary
This week, I learned the basics of HTML including how to create structured web pages using tags like <html>, <head>, <body>, <a>, <p>, <ul>, <table>, and <form>. I built a simple portfolio website with navigation links, personal information, interests, and a project table. I also created a student admission form using various input types like text, radio, date, select, and textarea.

Week 2 Summary
This week, I learned how to style HTML using CSS. I practiced applying margins, padding, borders, colors, fonts, and hover effects. I also learned about inline-block, transitions, positioning, and layout design. I built styled profile pages and anime character cards using both internal and external CSS.

Week 3 Summary
This week, I learned about CSS Grid and CSS animations. I used @keyframes to create different animated loaders and patterns. I practiced using grid layout properties like grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, and grid-column/row to align and structure elements. I also explored transform properties like translate, rotate, and scale for animation effects.

Week 4 Summary
This week, I learned how to make web pages responsive using media queries and flexbox. I designed layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and practiced using flex-wrap, gap, vw units, and responsive font/image scaling. I built a responsive design agency page and a flexible layout grid with boxes adjusting at different breakpoints.

Week 5 Summary 
I explored Bootstrap through a hands-on tutorial where I learned to build a responsive blog website. I used components like navbar, cards, buttons, and carousel to design different sections. The tutorial also covered the grid system and how to structure layouts effectively. Overall, it was a practical and engaging way to understand front-end development with Bootstrap.

ðŸ§¾ Week 6 Summary
This week, I learned to use JavaScript for DOM manipulation and dynamic content generation. I built two interactive projects:
QR Code Generator â€“ allows users to enter text or a URL to instantly generate and download a QR code using the qrcodejs library.
Hourglass Pattern Generator â€“ takes an odd number as input and displays a symmetric star pattern in the shape of an hourglass using loops and conditionals.
These projects helped me practice handling user input, using event listeners, and dynamically updating HTML using JavaScript.

Week 7 & 8 Summary (Final Project)
In the final weeks, I applied all my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge to build a 15 Puzzle Game. This project helped me understand DOM manipulation, grid layout design, event handling, array management, and game logic implementation. I used JavaScript to create interactive tiles, handle user moves, validate logic, and shuffle the puzzle dynamically. Styling was done using CSS Grid and custom design for a smooth UI/UX.
This project tied together all core web development concepts Iâ€™ve learned throughout the course.
