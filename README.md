My Web Development Learning Journey

Week 1 Summary
This week, I learned the basics of HTML including how to create structured web pages using tags like <html>, <head>, <body>, <a>, <p>, <ul>, <table>, and <form>. I built a simple portfolio website with navigation links, personal information, interests, and a project table. I also created a student admission form using various input types like text, radio, date, select, and textarea.

Week 2 Summary
This week, I learned how to style HTML using CSS. I practiced applying margins, padding, borders, colors, fonts, and hover effects. I also learned about inline-block, transitions, positioning, and layout design. I built styled profile pages and anime character cards using both internal and external CSS.

Week 3 Summary
This week, I learned about CSS Grid and CSS animations. I used @keyframes to create different animated loaders and patterns. I practiced using grid layout properties like grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, and grid-column/row to align and structure elements. I also explored transform properties like translate, rotate, and scale for animation effects.

Week 4 Summary
This week, I learned how to make web pages responsive using media queries and flexbox. I designed layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and practiced using flex-wrap, gap, vw units, and responsive font/image scaling. I built a responsive design agency page and a flexible layout grid with boxes adjusting at different breakpoints.
